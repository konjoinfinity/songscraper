# Song Scraper ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµðŸŽ¸ðŸŽ¹ðŸ“„

## An ultimate-guitar chord chart scraper that creates a new google doc and applies formatting.

## Features

- [x] Accepts an ultimate-guitar url, scrapes the song data, creates a new google docs document from a template with the song name, and inserts the formatted text into the song template.
- [x] Removes '[ ]' brackets from section titles.
- [x] Recognizes various musical chords and associated notation.
- [x] Filters and updates formatting (bold/unbold) for section titles, chords, lyrics, and more.
- [x] Automatically renames the document as: 'song name - artist'.
- [x] Automatically opens and closes the browser.
- [x] Works with a variety of song formats from Ultimate Guitar, removes comments, splits the text to fit into two columns.

## Room for Improvement

- [ ] Adding the ability to choose the song key/capo.
- [ ] Adding another browser tab/window the newly created document after completion.
- [ ] Proxy for puppeteer, to appear from a different IP address each scrape.
- [ ] Adding human like actions like clicking, moving the mouse randomly, selecting, etc. to appear as a normal user.
- [ ] Logic to recognize repeating chord patterns within sections, delete duplicates and move chord progression next to the section title.
- [ ] Automatically export to PDF and download after doc creation and formatting completes.
- [ ] Deploy to a live url, not necessary but might be useful in the future.

## Motivation

Built to automate a manual process. I copy chord charts from ultimate-guitar and manually format song chart documents, this program automates that process.
